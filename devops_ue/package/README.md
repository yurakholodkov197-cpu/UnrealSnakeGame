# Unreal Engine scripts for game packaging

You can find more information about packaging process [on the following page](https://lifeexe-art.gitbook.io/unreal-automation/proekt-ue/game-cooking).

* **package_game.bat**   - creates package for game target
* **package_client.bat** - creates package for client target
* **package_server.bat** - creates package for server target
* **package_client_with_server.bat** - creates package for both client and server targets

*Note that the client/server packages require Unreal Engine build from sources.*
