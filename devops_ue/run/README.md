# Unreal Engine helper scripts for quick client/server launch

Before using the scripts from the current folder, you must first pack the client/server (use **package** dir scripts for this purpose).

* **run_server.bat** - runs dedicated server executable from **Build** folder
* **run_listen_server.bat.bat** - runs listen server executable from **Build** folder
* **run_2_clients.bat** - runs two client executables from **Build** folder
